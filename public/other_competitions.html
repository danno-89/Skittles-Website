                <p>During the season, on a number of Fridays, Individual and Pairs competitions are held as well as the 4-A-Side Knockout tournament held at Easter time.</p>
                <p>Previously, registration for these competitions only required a player to turn up on the night, however, a more structured approach is being adopted going forward to help the committee organise these competitions better.</p>
                <p>As such, players can now register for these tournaments from the start of the season. Each tournament will have a registration closure date (usually 2 weeks beforehand) where the initial draw will be completed.</p>
                <p>Players will still be able to register by showing up on the night, but they will be drawn into the preliminary round (or earliest equivalent) on a first come, first-drawn basis.</p>
                <p>Details of the competition date, registration deadlines and tournament draw (when available) will be shown here.</p>
                <p>As always, if there are any issues, please do not hesitate to contact the committee by email (sarniaskittles@gmail.com), by phone, or in person.</p>
