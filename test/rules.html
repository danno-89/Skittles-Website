                <li><span class="rule-number">3.3.4</span> Teams may play out of order if one or more of the players is absent from the alley, however this should be reduced to a minimum wherever possible to avoid delay.</li>
                <li><span class="rule-number">3.3.5</span> Any player arriving late may join the game from the current hand being played but cannot play any hands they have missed.</li>
